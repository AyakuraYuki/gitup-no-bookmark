# gitup-no-bookmark

gitup without bookmark, rewrite from [earwig/git-repo-updater](https://github.com/earwig/git-repo-updater)

this is just a updater, removed all features that I don't need

**I highly recommend you to use the [original version](https://github.com/earwig/git-repo-updater) to support [earwig](https://github.com/earwig).**

> ## Installation
> 
> With [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip/):
> 
>     pip install gitup
> 
> With [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):
> 
>     brew install gitup
> 
> ### From source
> 
> First:
> 
>     git clone git://github.com/earwig/git-repo-updater.git
>     cd git-repo-updater
> 
> Then, to install for everyone:
> 
>     sudo python setup.py install
> 
> or for just yourself (make sure you have `~/.local/bin` in your PATH):
> 
>     python setup.py install --user
> 
> Finally, simply delete the `git-repo-updater` directory, and you're done!
> 
> __Note:__ If you are using Windows, you may wish to add a macro so you can
> invoke gitup in any directory. Note that `C:\python27\` refers to the
